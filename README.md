# FB-message-analyst
Given the name of a Facebook friend, FB message analyst can plot the relative rate of messages and accumulation of messages over time. 

When Main_Fetch_Data.py is run, it prompts the user for a name and produces a graph showing accumulated messages over time with that friend.

Additionally, two textfiles are created:
1. Conversation.txt - a complete conversation history with human-readable timestamps
2. Timestamps.txt - a record of number of messages over time, with unix timestamps (used to produce the graph)
